This project contains **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams** for three systems:

1. **Library Management System**
2. **Restaurant Reservation System**
3. **Real Estate Listing System**

The ER diagrams are created using **Graphviz (Chen Notation)** and **Mermaid.js (Crowâ€™s Foot Notation)** inside a **Quarto (`.qmd`) report**. The report also includes explanations of design choices and relationships.
